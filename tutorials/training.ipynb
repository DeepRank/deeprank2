    "  - If the `standardize` key is `True`, standardization is applied after transformation. Standardization consists in applying the following formula on each feature's value: ${x' = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}}$, being ${\\mu}$ the mean and ${\\sigma}$ the standard deviation. Standardization is a scaling method where the values are centered around mean with a unit standard deviation.\n",
    "  - The transformation to apply can be speficied as a lambda function as a value of the key `transform`, which defaults to `None`.\n",
    "  - Since in the provided example standardization is applied, the training features' means and standard deviations need to be used for scaling validation and test sets. For doing so, `train_source` parameter is used. When `train_source` parameter is set, it will be used to scale the validation/testing sets. You need to pass `features_transform` to the training dataset only, since in other cases it will be ignored and only the one of `train_source` will be considered.\n",
