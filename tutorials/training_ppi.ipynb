Navigate into it, and after having activated the environment and installed [pytest](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pytest), run `pytest tests`. All tests should pass. We recommend installing `deeprankcore` and all its dependencies into a [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) environment.\n",

See the [docs](https://deeprankcore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html) for more details about all the possible pre-implemented features. \n",
    "- For the `GraphDataset` class only it is possible to define a dictionary to indicate which transformations to apply to the features, being the transformations lambda functions and/or standardization. If `True`, standardization is applied after transformation, if the latter is present. Standardization consists in applying the following formula on each feature's value: ${x' = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma}}$, being ${\\mu}$ the mean and ${\\sigma}$ the standard deviation. Standardization is a scaling method where the values are centered around mean with a unit standard deviation. In the example below we will apply a logarithmic transformation and then standardization to all the features. It is also possible to use specific features as keys for indicating that we want to apply transformation and/or standardization to few features only. \n",
    "- Since we are applying standardization, we need to use training features' means and standard deviations to scale validation and test sets. For doing so, `train` and `dataset_train` parameters are used. When `train` is set `False`, a `dataset_train` of the same class must be provided and it will be used to scale the validation/testing set according to its features values. You need to pass `features_transform` to the training dataset only, since in other cases it will be ignored and only the one of `dataset_train` will be considered. \n",
